# Escape Ed
This one was hilarious.
The goal was to escape ed, a notorious line-editor that is well-known for it's error message (that's right, only one error message), '?'. In fact, if it doesn't understand what you type, it just prints out that error message. So, as someone who didn't know how to exit it properly (a teammate said the correct way was 'q'), I tried the following:
1. :q! (vim exit... ok pretty sure this wasn't going to work)
1. quit
1. CTRL+C (yup that doesn't work)
1. CTRL+D (ah, that was it :D)

In all fairness, if CTRL+D didn't work I would've googled it or looked up the man pages. :D

This ended up giving challenge 3 as a result.
