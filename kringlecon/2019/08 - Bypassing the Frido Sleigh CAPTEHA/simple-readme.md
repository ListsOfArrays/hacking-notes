# 7) Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
## Prompt
Help Krampus beat the Frido Sleigh contest. For hints on achieving this objective, please talk with Alabaster Snowball in the Speaker Unpreparedness Room.
## Secondary Prompt
Hello there! I’m Krampus Hollyfeld.
I maintain the steam tunnels underneath Elf U,
Keeping all the elves warm and jolly.
Though I spend my time in the tunnels and smoke,
In this whole wide world, there's no happier bloke!
Yes, I borrowed Santa’s turtle doves for just a bit.
Someone left some scraps of paper near that fireplace, which is a big fire hazard.
I sent the turtle doves to fetch the paper scraps.
But, before I can tell you more, I need to know that I can trust you.
Tell you what – if you can help me beat the Frido Sleigh contest (Objective 8), then I'll know I can trust you.
The contest is here on my screen and at fridosleigh.com.
No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want, so I am!
They set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic, cookie needs.
Unfortunately, it's restricted to elves only, and I can't bypass the CAPTEHA.
(That's Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Elves and Humans Apart.)
I've already cataloged 12,000 images and decoded the API interface.
Can you help me bypass the CAPTEHA and submit lots of entries?
## Solve Process
1. I listened to TensorFlow system requirements unlike the idiotic walkthrough :D.
...
1. The exact requirements!
    
    No .1 differences!
    
    I downloaded it from Pip!
    
    I didn't compile it myself! *technically this is true as it never worked haha*

1. Also in this case use TensorFlow 1.15, version 2 is not backwards-compatible with this script.
1. Skip the default inceptionnet model, and instead go for the faster mobilenet model from the start (https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_100_224/quantops/feature_vector/3), following the advice of https://hackernoon.com/creating-insanely-fast-image-classifiers-with-mobilenet-in-tensorflow-f030ce0a2991.
1. Remember to remove the trailing "," to avoid having a blank entry.
1. Now that we entered 101 times, we won the contest & got an email sent to us with the flag.
1. This makes Krampus happy, and we get a prompt for challenge 9 (which we've already solved by this point haha)

## New prompt:
You did it! Thank you so much. I can trust you!
To help you, I have flashed the firmware in your badge to unlock a useful new feature: magical teleportation through the steam tunnels.
As for those scraps of paper, I scanned those and put the images on my server.
I then threw the paper away.
Unfortunately, I managed to lock out my account on the server.
Hey! You’ve got some great skills. Would you please hack into my system and retrieve the scans?
I give you permission to hack into it, solving Objective 9 in your badge.
And, as long as you're traveling around, be sure to solve any other challenges you happen across.
