# The Holiday Hack Trail Minigame (Hard)

For this one I didn't try to cheat (after trying several simple web-style hacks that didn't work at all: this was probably crypto but if we don't have to do crypto that's a win hahaha).

The strategy is to buy all the reindeer, and then continue at a grueling pace until all but one of your party is dead.
Then, start hunting, and continue on. Heal up last party member with meds.
You should find random ammo drops to continue hunting when needed.
Ford the river with caulk, and continue hunting / grueling.

We won!
```
Result:
Emma died of Toothache on 23 October
Evie died of starvation on 20 October
Jane died of Toothache on 6 October
Sally is filled with Christmas cheer!
Date completed: 16 December
Reindeer remaining: 3
Money remaining: 0
Scoring:

1 surviving party members X 1000 = 1000 points
3 reindeer X 400 = 1200 points
0 money left X 1 = 0 points
Journey completed on 16 December: 9 days before Christmas X 50 = 450 points
Total score: (1000 + 1200 + 0 + 450) X 8 Hard multiplier = 21200!

The hint then is to look at the network tab for keys...
When we enter her room, we see that krampus.png is downloaded, and he has a big fat key attached to him.

Time to watch some videos on key binning :D
