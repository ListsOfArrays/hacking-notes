# How these writeups work
For these writeups, I decided to do something different & a bit silly.

While going through the CTF I documented every single solve method, including most of the rabbit holes so long as I believed I was making progress.

These writeups may be found written as "**idiotic-readme**" markdown files. Feel free to open them, but beware! Antivirus scanners may tag challenges 4 and 6. They're called "idiotic readmes" do to the silliness on display by me. :)

For quite a few challenges, I also included simplified readmes, stored under "**simple-readme**" files. These will be missing most of the rabbit holes and are similar to traditional writeups.

If you're a beginner, reading the long-format solves may help, as too often the simple writeups are like cooking shows, and skip the learning process... but still, going into every rabbit hole should be avoided if possible. But this is how my brain solves CTFs... so rabbit holes there are & will be :D

Also, there are additional python and powershell scripts that are included whenever I thought it was a good idea to write some code. These are messy scripts, but hopefully they show some of the learning process as well.

Finally, for challenges that involved getting something or decrypting something, and for challenges where the initial provided files are small enough, those initial files and the decrypted files are usually included here as well, in the advent that.

**Hope these help, and feel free to contact me through GitHub's interface if you have questions or comments or concerns.**
