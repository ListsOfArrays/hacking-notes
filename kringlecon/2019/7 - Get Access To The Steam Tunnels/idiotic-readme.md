# 7) Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
# Break into Krampus's lock
## notes
When we first reached in the dormitory and saw an open door, it downloaded Krampus.png, which had a big key attached to it.
1. Eyeballing it, tit looks like 122420, but that's wrong.
1. Downloading Deviant Ollam's tool, we find the actual bitting of 122520, which lets us in the steam tunnels.
1. This gives us the prompt from Krampus:
```
Hello there! I’m Krampus Hollyfeld.
I maintain the steam tunnels underneath Elf U,
Keeping all the elves warm and jolly.
Though I spend my time in the tunnels and smoke,
In this whole wide world, there's no happier bloke!
Yes, I borrowed Santa’s turtle doves for just a bit.
Someone left some scraps of paper near that fireplace, which is a big fire hazard.

I sent the turtle doves to fetch the paper scraps.
But, before I can tell you more, I need to know that I can trust you.
Tell you what – if you can help me beat the Frido Sleigh contest (Objective 8), then I'll know I can trust you.
The contest is here on my screen and at fridosleigh.com.
No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want, so I am!
They set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic, cookie needs.
Unfortunately, it's restricted to elves only, and I can't bypass the CAPTEHA.
(That's Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Elves and Humans Apart.)
I've already cataloged 12,000 images and decoded the API interface.
Can you help me bypass the CAPTEHA and submit lots of entries?
```
1. That's the answer to Objective 7, "Krampus Hollyfeld".
1. He gives us a bunch of catalogued images and the capteha_api.py.
